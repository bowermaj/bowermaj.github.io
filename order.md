## Request an order

Information about how to order.  This top content can be edited in the file 'order.md'.

The below form gets automatically made when you add files inside the '/_sweets' folder.

This form isn't hooked up to any payment method. It will just send an email with the order
details, so the order can be followed up by phone to collect payment (PayID?) and other 
details? Hopefully that's enough for the first phase.  Next phase potentally pay for 
something like shopify.
